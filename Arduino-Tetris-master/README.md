This is code for an implementation of Tetris on Arduino using Max72xx chips and LED matrices.
The setup used is two 8x8 dual colour led matrices - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/681
Four max72xx chips are used (two cascaded controlling red 8x8s and two cascaded controlling green 8x8s).
The code is easily editable to control more leds (using more chips) or even single colour if required.
